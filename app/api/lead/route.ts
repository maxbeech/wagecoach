// are configured — OpenHelm Mail (OPENHELM_API_KEY + OPENHELM_MAIL_INBOX_ID) and/or a partner
// webhook (LEAD_WEBHOOK_URL, e.g. an attorney-network intake, CRM or Zapier
// hook). Nothing is stored here: the site is otherwise database-free, so
// delivery is the single integration point. If a channel is configured but
// fails, we tell the user to email us directly rather than silently dropping
// the lead. If no channel is configured at all, the route still accepts the
// submission so the form works in every environment.

// Lead-gen to attorneys is regulated and varies by state bar (referral-fee and
// advertising rules). This forwards an inquiry the user initiated; it is not a
// referral-fee arrangement. Confirm the model with counsel before going live.
